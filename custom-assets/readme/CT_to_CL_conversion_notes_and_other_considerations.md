## movement in CT 

CT supplement 4 the lost rules  
Movement (1977)
The movement table indicates the number of rounds which must be spent in one range before moving to the next range.

|----| ( is this the number of rounds ? )| 
|----| ----|       
|Close| 1|  
|Short | 1|  
| Medium | 3 |  
| Long | 4 |  
| Very Long | 5 |  

As an example of movement, the movement table indicates that long range is 4 rounds ‚deep‛ (it requires a character to close or open for four rounds before he is
at the next range). A character would thus be required to state that he is closing for four rounds before he could be at medium range.
( but none of this actually states how many meters have been moved by the character in those 4 rounds )

Movement (1981)
Characters may move one band per combat round if walking or two if running; animals may move faster, as covered in Book 3.
( NOTE comparing this 1981 rule with the 1983 rule both align with only minor changes in wording such as references to book3 ( 1981 ) vs 'as covered in the chapter on animal encounters (1983) )
( the 1981 rules contradict the 1977 rules?, e.g. it takes 4 rounds to move to one of the adjacent range bands, medium or very long. the 1981 rules as I understand implies that it takes the same time, 1 round, to move from close to medium as it does from medium to long. again none of this actually states how many meters have been moved by the character, and compared to the 1977 rules, it implies either the distances between bands are the same if the the same 1 round is required to move from one band to another - this makes no sense. I suspect this move one band per combat round was introduced in 1981 to simplify combat at the expense of logic and realism )

Animal Characteristics (1977)
the animal characteristics table, last column titled typical speed, for e.g. chaser... triple/double 
Speeds: Animals will move at ordinary speed (one column per round) or at double or triple speed. Some animals may not move (speed = none). When two speeds are specified, the first applies on a throw of 7+, otherwise the second applies.
( this does not answer my question, whilst characters can move at walk or running speed, does the same apply to the speed for animals ? e.g. this triple/double notation - is it the animals maximum speed ? )

CT (1981) ( source https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/355200/classic-traveller-facsimile-edition )
Refer page 31 and 32 ( note the range band table is the as the CT starter edition (1983) page 7, book 2 charts )
For reference purposes, the distance equivalents of the ranges used in combat are given on the range table on the next page.
close in physical contact touching  
short at sword or polearm point, 1 to 5 meters  
medium at pistol range 6 to 50  
long at rifle range 51 to 250  

Movement  
For movement, distances are measured in range bands, each representing approximately 25 meters. The range band table gives the size of the combat ranges in range bands. 
close, short 0
medium 1 to 2  
long 3 to 10 
very long 11 to 20 


characters may move one band per combat round if walking or two if running; animals may move faster, as covered in Book 3. ( this sentence is the same as the CT starter edition (1983) page 20, book 1)
( Note in the 1983 rules for animal encounter s1 is same speed as character) s2 is double speed ( running) etc )


CT the Traveller book (1982)
Refer page 38 
Square Grid Activity: Many deck plans, floor plans, or other maps for Traveller are drawn with a square grid, usually representing squares of 1.5 meters each. If grids of this or similar scales are used, then changes should be made to the range band system. Walking speed is 8 squares per combat round. Running is 16 squares per combat round. Greater speeds are in multiples of 8 squares per combat round. Specific activities such as opening doors or hatches each take one combat round, during which time the individual should be treated as evading.

8 squares at 1.5 metres is 5.3 ( round down to 5 ) = 5 grid squares. 
see also https://www.travellerrpg.com/threads/range-bands-and-square-grid-activity.40102/  
see also https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Errata-Classic_Traveller ( I searched these and could not find any errata mentioning range band grid square movement )

CT starter edition (1983)
Refer page 7, traveller stater edition 1983, book 2 charts, range band table 
how many metres is one band on the range band table ? - one range band is approximately 17 squares ( at 1.5m per square)

| band | range | add in this 3rd column to compare the metres from the combat ranges listed in the previous table to this table | comment |
|----| ----| ----| ----|   
| 0 | close or short | 0 to 5m | |
| 1 to 2 | medium | 6 to 50m | I'm confused. if 1 range band is 17 squares ~12m then how does this map to 6 to 50 ? |
| 3 to 10 | long | 51 to 250m | |  

if one range band is 17 squares / 1.5 metres = 11.3m ( round down to 11 or up to 12? 12 fits better with 1.5m as 12/1.5 = 8 which is consistent wiht 1982 rules ).
if characters may move one range band per combat round that is 12m 

Refer page 7, traveller stater edition, book 2 charts, speed table 
| speed | band | squares | my comments | 
|----| ----| ----| ----|  
| walking | 1 | 17 | 12m |
| running(double) | 2 | 33 | 24m in 6 seconds. | 
| running(triple) | 3 | 50 | 33m in 6 seconds can humans run this fast ? |
| running(quadruple) | 4 | 67 | 44.6 ~ 45m in 6 seconds. |

(TODO - how can anyone run at triple or quadruple speed ?  so e.g. convert 45m in 6 seconds to 10 seconds is 10/6 = 1.6 x45 = 75m. a world record olympic sprint can run 100m in 10 seconds.) 

my conclusion. the combat range distances in meters does not align with movement range bands. i.e. distance on a grid ( especially on a VTT ) is the same whether it is used to calculate movement or to calculate the range of a ranged weapon. The 1982 rules with reference to grid square 1.5 and character can walk 8 squares = 12m per round is what was then also used in the 1983 rules.  


## movement in CE SRD 
combat - minor action - the character moves up to six meters. ( 1.5m per grid square ) = 4 grid squares. terrain can reduce the movement from 6 down. crouching halves the movement ( to 3m ) for e.g. crawling in a vent pipe ?. 
A character can take two minor actions instead of a significant action. ( i'm assuming this means 2 different minor actions i.e not 2 movement actions )
( so it seems in mg1e / CE SRD the 12m per round was reduced to 6m )


## movement in CL 
Refer the combat section. move up to 9m ( 6 x 1.5m squares) 
(why has CL changed from 6m to 9m )
Refer the combat section, Frenzy, may move 1.5m and immediately attack an adjacent enemy
Refer the cybernetics section, bionic legs  This implant also doubles the character's movement speed to 18m per action (up to 36m per round if the character uses both actions for movement).
( this suggests my assumption of the CE SRD rules regarding two minor actions was incorrect )


## movement in CD 
Refer the combat section. 
On their turn, each character has two actions. They may use them for attacks, movement, and other action.
Refer the combat section, list of actions, move up to 10m.  
( why has CD changed from 9m to 10m if 10m does not fit the 1.5m grid square multiple ). see also https://www.reddit.com/r/cepheusengine/comments/11rvyc4/cepheus_deluxe_grid_size_question/  

Refer the combat section, Frenzy, may move 2m and immediately attack an adjacent enemy
Refer the animal movement section, (a human’s average walking speed) 10m per combat round. 

The animal movement speed table generates ( using die roll) multipliers applied to the (a human’s average walking speed) 10m per combat round. for e.g. the grazer is
1D-2 with a mimimun of 20 m/action ( i.e. double speed ). a roll of 6-2 = 4 x 10 - 40 metres per combat round ( this seems illogical what animal can move 40 metres in 6 seconds ? ). 


also consider questions such as. 
can you run in combat ? 
logically a character in a vacc suit cannot move as easily or as fast as a character not in a vacc suit. can a character run in a vacc suit ( have them roll a task check to do so - if fumble - roll for damage on vacc suit if they fall )  

# combat damage calculations 
Note as per CL rules the twoddsix module is adding the effect to the damage roll. ( e.g. need 6 to hit roll 8 - effect is 2.. roll 2d6 for damage + 2 )

# (ranged) combat weapon range (band) modifiers 
CL does not use range bands.  
CL simplifies this down to this down to effective range ( 8+ ) and effective range up to maximum range ( throw 10+)
Unlike CE SRD range bands table see https://www.orffenspace.com/cepheus-srd/personal-combat.html CL simplifies this down to applying a -2DM if trying to use a gun in melee range. 


# convert the animals from CT to CL 

## animal hits and armor

I converted the player characters to CL and then by the time I converted the animals to CL did I realise that CL does not include a chapter in the rules for animals. CD does include rules for animals ( Xenofauna encounters ).  
Rather than convert the player characters to CD I chose to use the animals chapter from CD and retrofit this to CL ( given that the animals chapter in CD is based on the animals chpater in CT ).

animals encounter table from the adventure pdf

| die | qty | animal type | weight | hits | armor |  wounds & weapons | reactions |  
| --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |  --------------------- | --------------------- |  
|0 | | amphibian grazer | 1kg | 2/0 | none | 3 teeth-1 ( -1 is DM to the combat roll NOT damage ) | F8 A5 S2 |  
|1 | | amphibian grazer | 3kg | 4/1 | jack | 4 teeth-1 | F7 A5 S2 |  
|2 | | amphibian grazer | 3kg | 6/0 | jack | 5 teeth+1 | F6 A5 S2 |  
|3 | | |
|4 | | chasers | 3kg | 2/5 | jack | 4 claws | F8 A6 S3 |  
|5 | | chasers | 6kg | 5/3 | mesh | 7 claws | F7 A9 S3 |  
|6 | | flying hunters | 6kg | 4/4 | jack | 5 as blade | F4 A9 S4 |  
|7 | | flying hunters | 12kg | 6/0 | jack | 7 as blade | F5 A8 S4 |  
|8 | | flying hunters | 12kg | 9/0 | jack | 10 as blade | F5 A5 S4 |  

For hits in CT the 1st number is the num of hits before the animal is unconcious. the 2nd number is total number of hits until dead. 
e.g. 4 / 1 - 4 hits for unconcious. 1 hit > 4 ( i.e. 5 ) for death. If animal takes dbl the total e.g. 10 in this example the animal is destroyed ( blown apart )
i.e. cannot be examined or skinned or used for other purposes. 

in CT the weapon type does fixed damage. ( fixed damage = X number of D. 'fixed damage' is confusing terminology. CT has fixed damage and variable damage. The fixed damage is simply a pre-generated roll of variable damage) for e.g.  
claws 2D  
teeth 2D  
blade 2D  

( refer the range matrix table page 55 of CT fascimile reprint v3 lists claws as 2D. Note teeth isn't listed )  
( refer the weapons and range matrix table under personal combat page 6 of CT starter edition charts claws AND teeth as 2D )  

Note regarding wounds & weapons column in CT. The fixed wound number has been pre-rolled for simplicity. Variable damage can be rolled each time the animal hits
but this then requires the referee to cross reference the animals weight ( e.g. 1 has a -2D DM ) and the weapon type ( e.g. teeth 2D )

weapon / wound 
teeth -2D means teeth does 2d6. but then roll 2d6 2nd roll and minus from the 1st roll. eg. 1st roll is 10. 2nd roll is 8.  damage is 2. 
teeth -1 means apply -1 to the attack roll.  Note CT applies a DM for the range ( e.g. close +1 and short +2 ). CT also applies a DM for the weapon type vs armor.

CL does not include any entry for animals size and damage ( so refer CL upgraded or CD for example )

NOTE in CT the wounds DM is 'rolled' for e.g. claws 2D damage and -2D wounds DM means roll 2d6 for damage, roll 2d6 and subtract this from the 1st roll to calculate
the total damage.

In CD, animal size, stamine /lifeblood and damage table page 196  The damage column modifies the amount of damage dice the animal’s a�acks inflict. See the animal weapons table for the baseline damage. For example, if a weapon causes 2D damage by default but the “Damage Modifier” column indicated -1D, this animal’s weapon will only cause 1D damage. ( this does not sound correct in cepheus see below  )

NOTE that in CD this 'damage modifier' does not work the same as how it works in CT.  

| weight(kg)| stamina/lifeblood | Damage Modifier|
|--|--|--|
| 3| 1D/1D (in CL this can be replaced with CT style hits to unconcious / hits to death | -2D |

so for example in CD a 3kg animal with claws ( 2D damage ) is cancelled out by the -2D damage modifier to 0D damage. 

CD rules state, If the table reduces a weapon’s damage dice to zero, each attack causes only 1 point of damage.

Refer the CD animal size table. note the animals weight determines the damage modifier.

1kg -2D  
3kg -2D  
6kg -1D ( so what do you do for animals 3 to 6 kg? note also that CT animal sizes and weaponry table has the same size progression 1 3 6 12 25 )  

Refer the CD animal weapons table    
weapons / damage / armor   
claws 2D   
teeth 2D  
claws / teeth 2D/2D ( 2 attacks )    

so trying to convert the CT shadows adventure amphibian graziers teeth-1 to CL.  
Amphibian Grazer 1kg 2/0 none teeth-1 F8 A5 S2 - animal weight is 1 - on the table damage modifier is -2D. cancels out to 0 so damage is 1.  
Amphibian Grazer 3kg 4/1 jack teeth-1 F7 A5 S2 - animal weight is 3 - on the table damage modifier is -2D. cancels out to 0 so damage is 1.  

so basically in CL / CD these animals will be a nuisance to characters in a vacc suit ? or perhaps the damage comes from attacking in large numbers?  
also NOTE in CL the effect is added to the damage so depending on the roll even a 1kg amphibian grazer might inflict more than 1 damage but vacc suit is armor protection 6 which is -6 from the damage roll. 
so for e.g. for the 1kg animal to hit roll at least 9 ( 8+ to to hit -1 ), if roll maximum of 12 resulting in 11, the effect is 11-8 = 3, total damage is 1+3 = 4, minus 6 for vacc suit = no damage.
The same damage applies for the 3kg animals which also have a -2DM offsetting the claws or teeth 2D.    

comparison with CT for the 1kg amphibian grazer 
Refer the weapons and range matrix table 
To hit roll 8+  
DMs  
vacc suit acts as cloth armor when subject to attacks. DM for teeth vs cloth +0. 
close range +2 
need to roll a 6+ to hit. 
1kg animal has a -2D wounds DM. teeth inflicts 2D hits.  
maximum damage inflicted. roll 12 on damage, roll 2 for -2D wounds DM = 12 -2 = 10 hits damage  
lowest damage inflicted. roll 2 on damage, roll 12 for -2DM wounds = 2 - 12 = -10 which is < 0 so 0 hits damage.  
NOTE The encounter table lists the 1kg amphibian grazer wounds as 3 ( this was pre-rolled result in the range 0 to 10 )

so it can be seen that in CT the 1kg amphibian grazer has an easier to hit roll against a player in a vacc suit ( 6 vs 8 for CL ) and when the animal hits it easily inflicts wounds 0, or 1 to 10. I suspect the enounter table wounds values were chosen by design rather than rolled as the wounds increase ( almost ) linearly from
the top to the bottom of the table. 

also note the qty encountered in the animal encounter table - 12. Even if using the fixed wound of 3 - 3x12 = 36 hits - in one round if all 12 hit ( and with 6+ to hit most of the 12 probably will hit ). So even the 1kg animal pack in CT is a deadly encounter. 

see also https://www.reddit.com/r/traveller/comments/1hcdv4y/classic_traveller_animal_encounter_table_wounds/

reverting back to CD as per the damage table animal needs to be 6kg to have -1D damage modifier. claws does 2D. so a 6kg animal is going to do 1D6 damage. 

| animal type | weight | hits | armor |  wounds & weapons | reactions |  
| --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |  --------------------- | --------------------- |  
| chaser | 6kg | 5/3 | (3) mesh | claws | A7 F9 S3 | 

If a character gets hit by a chaser 2D damage from claws
so for e.g. for the 3kg animal to hit roll at least 8+, if roll maximum on 2D of 12, the effect is 4, min damage = 1+4-6 for vacc suit armor protection rating =0, max damage is 6+4-6 = 4.

To cause any damage the chaser must roll 9 to hit, the effect is 1, damage is 6+1-6 = 1  
A 6kg animal with claws or teeth can cause 1 to 4 points damage. 

so for example the Flying Hunters 12kg converted from CT to CL  

| animal type | weight | hits | armor |  wounds & weapons | reactions |  
| --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |  --------------------- | --------------------- |  
| Flying Hunters | 12kg | 9/0 | (2) jack | replace CT 'as blade which in CT does 2D' teeth OR claws | A5 F5 S4 | 

the toughest flyer has 9 hits. in cepheus a 12kg animal has Damage Modifier of -- ( none ). If a character gets hit by a flyer 2D damage from teeth or claws.
so for e.g. for the 12kg animal to hit roll at least 8+, if roll maximum on 2D of 12, the effect is 4, min damage = 2+4-6 for vacc suit armor protection rating =0, max damage is 12+4-6 = 10.

if modify the flyer to have claws & teeth ( 2 attacks )
the toughest flyer has 9 hits. 2 attacks. 2D damage for each. 
so for e.g. min damage 0 on both claws and teeth, maximum damage 20 ( 10+10) on both claws and teeth. 
If a character gets hit by a flyer with both teeth and claws they could easily be seriously wouded / unconcious or even close to death.  

Consult the Animal Armor table for the animal’s Protection rating. ( a number 0 to 10 ), what this means is consult the armor table to see what the number corresponds to e.g. 2 is jack. ( this is really badly worded )

In CD subtract the armor’s protection rating from any physical damage caused to the character before applying the damage to the character’s Stamina and Lifeblood. 

rather than consult the values in the table from cepheus I could simply use the CT armor listing for the shadows adventure animals ( none, jack, mesh ) and apply this 
as the protection rating rather than what is on the animal table 
none 0
jack 2
mesh 3

note in CD roll 2 times on the animal weapons table. 1st roll is to determine weapon type AND damage. 2nd roll ( same table ) is to to determine the armor protection rating.  i believe there is an error. says roll for armor an apply same DMs as for the 1st roll. but then it says roll 2D-7 + animal size roll + DM's if herbivore carnivore  flyer etc. I believe the 2nd instruction is correct ( does stellagamma proof read ? )


the table below represents the initial conversion to CL 

| die | qty | animal type | weight | hits | armor(protection rating) |  wounds & weapons CT values | CL damage | CD damage using armor as DM to hit |reactions |  
| --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |  --------------------- | --------------------- |  --------------------- | --------------------- | 
|0 | 12| amphibian grazer | 1kg | 2/0 | none(0) | 3(0to10) teeth-1 ( -1 is DM to the combat roll NOT damage ) | 0 | 0to1 | F8 A5 S2 |  
|1 | 8| amphibian grazer | 3kg | 4/1 | jack(2) | 4(0to10)teeth-1 | 0 | 0to2 |F7 A5 S2 |  
|2 | 24| amphibian grazer | 3kg | 6/0 | jack(2) | 5(0to10) teeth+1 | 0 | 0to2 |F6 A5 S2 |  
|3 | | | |
|4 | 4| chasers | 3kg | 2/5 | jack(2) | 4(0to10) claws | 0 | 0to2| F8 A6 S3 | 
|5 | 12| chasers | 6kg | 5/3 | mesh(3) | 7(0to11) claws | 0to4 | 2to7 |F7 A9 S3 | 
|6 | 4| flying hunters | 6kg | 4/4 | jack(2) | 5(0to11) as blade | 0to4| 2to7 |F4 A9 S4 |   
|7 | 8| flying hunters | 12kg | 6/0 | jack(2) | 7(2to12) as blade | 0to10| 3to13 | F5 A8 S4 |  
|8 | 4| flying hunters | 12kg | 9/0 | jack(2) | 10(2to12) as blade | 0to10 | 3to13 |F5 A5 S4 |  

The issue in trying to convert these animals from CT to CL is that the 1 and 3kg animals if they can cause no damage to a character in a vacc suit then what is the point of these animals ? 

Using the CD optional rule armor protection as a modifier to the hit roll.

for the 1kg animal to hit roll at least 12 ( 8+ to to hit -1 and -3 for space (vacc) suit ), if roll maximum of 12 the effect is 0, max damage is 1(2D cancelled out by -2DM if results in 0 always inflicts 1).  
for the 3kg animal to hit roll at least 11 ( 8+ to hit and -3 for space (vacc) suit ), if roll maximum of 12 the effect is 1, max damage is 1+1(2D cancelled out by -2DM).  
for the 6kg animal to hit roll at least 11 ( 8+ to hit and -3 for space (vacc) suit ), if roll maximum of 12 the effect is 1, max damage is 1D+1(2D -1DM).  
e.g. for the 12kg animal to hit roll at least 11 ( 8+ to hit and -3 for space (vacc) suit ), if roll maximum of 12 the effect is 1, max damage is 2D+1(2D no DM).  

This at least allows the 1 and 3kg kg animals to cause 1 or 2 points of damage.  

Looking at another ruleset CE SRD where the damage depends on the animals strength.a 1kg animal has strength 1. a 1to10 strength causes 1D damage. In CE SRD a vacc 
suit has an armor protection rating of 6 same as in CD. So again, the 1kg animal cannot damage a person in a vacc suit.  

Vacc suit in CT is treated the same as cloth for DM on the to hit roll. refer the range matrix table page 41 of CT fascimile reprint v3 for description of cloth and vacc suit
CE SRD cloth armor protection rating is 9 ( better than a vacc suit 6 ).  
CD 'heavy ballistic' cloth armor protection rating is 6 ( same as vacc suit 6)
CL cloth armor protection rating is 6 ( same as vacc suit 6)

OR do not use the CD optional rule and house rule ( e.g. sharp teeth ) that the 1 and 3kg animals that cause no damage the 1kg animal causes 1 and the 3kg animal causes 2

OR do not use the CD optional rule and house rule that on a to hit roll of natural 12 causes 1 damage ( i.e. ignore the vacc suit -6 ) i.e. the animal was able to bite at a point in the vacc suit that was less protected think of this as a 'critical hit'.  
This option might allow for encounters with the 1 and 3kg animals to lull the player characters into a false sense of security. For example. the referee stages the game so the 1st encounters are with 1 and 3kg grazers or chasers - if the animals attack the players realise the vacc suits protect them from any damage ( except for the chance of a critical hit ). So when players then run into the 6 or 12 kg animals the players might assume their vacc suits will also protect them from these animals.  
If you then consider the logic that any hit that causes even 1 damage means the vacc suit integrity has been compromised then refer to the house rules on patching vacc suits ( TODO insert link to section )

e.g. 1 to 2 points. suit self seals.
2+ requires a patch. 

OR do not use the CD optional rule and house rule that the the vacc suits on the ship are lower spec in terms of armor protection rating of 4 or 5 not 6 ( an enviro suit is 3 )
so for e.g. for the 1kg animal to hit roll at least 9 ( 8+ to to hit -1 ), if roll maximum of 12 resulting in 11, the effect is 11-8 = 3, total damage is 1+3 = 4, minus 4 for vacc suit = no damage.
so for e.g. removing the teeth-1 for the 1kg animal to hit roll at least 8 ( 8+ ), if roll maximum of 12, the effect is 4, total damage is 1+4 = 5, minus 4 for vacc suit = 1 damage. 
The same damage applies for the 3kg animals which also have a -2DM offsetting the claws or teeth 2D. but to increase this damage from 1 to 2 rule a DM+1 on the to hit roll ( thus max roll becomes 12+1 for a max effect of 5 )    


the table below represents the comparison of damage

| animal type | weight |   wounds & weapons CT values | CL damage | CD damage<br> using armor as DM to hit |house rule<br>roll of 12 crit hit<br>for 1 and 3kg animals | vacc suit<br> armor rating<br> 4 not 6 | 
| --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |  --------------------- |  
| amphibian grazer | 1kg |  3(0to10) teeth-1 <br>( -1 is DM to the combat roll NOT damage ) | 0 | 0to1 | 1 |  0 |   
| amphibian grazer | 3kg |  4(0to10)teeth-1 | 0 | 0to2 |1 |  0 |   
| amphibian grazer | 3kg |  5(0to10) teeth+1 | 0 | 0to2 |1 | 0to2 ( teeth+1 changes the effect)  |   
| chasers | 3kg |  4(0to10) claws | 0 | 0to2| 1 | 0to1 |   
| chasers | 6kg |  7(0to11) claws | 0to4 | 2to7 |0to4 | 0to6 |    
| flying hunters | 6kg | 5(0to11) as blade | 0to4| 2to7 | 0to4 | 0to6 |      
| flying hunters | 12kg |  7(2to12) as blade | 0to10| 3to13 | 0to10 | 0to12 |    
| flying hunters | 12kg |  10(2to12) as blade | 0to10 | 3to13 |0to10 | 0to12 |   


I considered all of these options and decided to be somewhat inline with the progression of the CT wounds from smallest to largest animal and house rule that the 1 and
3kg animals can only inflict damage on a to hit natural roll of 12 ( ignoring the vacc suit -6 armor protection rating and applying a low damage ).
I then also changed the original qty ( how this was generated in CT I don't know as there seems to be an error in the CT rules ) 
Refer the animal encounter table generation checklist page 19 of CT fascimile reprint v3 
2C Determine the animal type and quantity using animal type table
Refer the animal type table page 18 of CT fascimile reprint v3 
The animal type table does not generate a qty at random only the animal type  
Refer the typical animal encounter table generation checklist page 19 of CT fascimile reprint v3 - this table has no qty column. 

I suspect the qty column in the adventure pdf - which uses fixed numbers - was by design and not random when Marc Miller wrote the adventure pdf. 

the table below represents the final conversion to CL

Reactions  
Sn is the animals speed. 
NOTE in CT the combat round is 15 seconds. In CE SRD / CL the combat round is 6 seconds.   
S0 imobile, S1 ordinary speed, S2 double speed ( what is ordinary speed in CT ? )  
S2=2x9=18m in 6 seconds for the amphibian grazer ( snake ) imho sounds like too much speed so I did some research some snakes can move at max speed of 2.5m second x 6 seconds combat round = 15m.   
Chasers S2    
Flyers have 2 speeds, S1 if crawling, S3 if flying.  
DMs  are applied to this table depending on location within the pyramid complex.  
Vertical Shaft: +4. ( if roll a 1+4 =5 chaser, in vertical shaft ? either modify this to +5 or if a chaser iis encountered in the shaft it is crawling on the vertical walls )
Large Central Chamber: +2.   
Large Corridor: no DM.   
Large Chamber: -3.  
Small Chamber: -4.  
Small Corridor: -3.  
Power Plant Area: no DM.  

Notes    
(1) base speed in CL is 9m. revise these speeds if using for e.g. CE SRD base speed 6m. Note characters can run ( double speed ) S2. 
A the damage only on a natural roll of 12  
B the damage only on a natural roll of 12. roll 1d6 1-2 =0, 2-4=1, 5-6=2  
The wounds & weapons CT values column has been included only for purposes of comparison between the animals in the adventure pdf and the animals converted to CL to highlight the 1kg and 3kg animals in CT caused more damage than when converted to CL. 


## saving throws  
For example. in the adventure pdf, location 9, as written
> It would require a leap to the cable (throw dexterity or less to succeed; DMs + vacc suit skill, - 3 if vacc suit skill is 0 or non-existent),followed by a slow descent (throw strength or less to succeed; DMs +vacc suit skill, +endurance, and -4 if vacc suit skill is 0 or non-existent).

Roll under was replaced with the UTP starting in Megatraveller or rule 68A task resolution mechanic in CT. In CL the referee would resolve this by applying a difficulty rating and apply DM's ( such as athletics in CL ). 

## convert character skills from CT to CL 
The 8 pre generated characters provided in the adventure pdf have been ( loosely ) converted to CL in terms of skills.  

refer to CTtoCLskillsconversion.xlsx  
 
NOTE CL assigns skills at a rank ( CT does not ?) e.g. 3rd rank Marine Force Commander ( Major in CL ) has tactics-1 - tactics is not listed for any of the CT pre generated characters in the adventure pdf. In CT the description of the skill tactics - it is left to the referee to decide how to apply this skill, no examples have been provided. 
In CL examples were included, tactics is used a bonus DM when determine initiative 

NOTE that cascade skills in CT ( and also in CE SRD which CL dervies from ) were (mostly) rolled into a single skill in CL e.g. gun combat covers seperate CT skills such as revolver shotgun etc. 

My house rule conversion is to add up the cascade skills and assign the total to the CL skill. e.g. laser rifle-2 and auto pistol-1 becomes gun combat-3. I suggest the referee review this for his / her game. In my opinion, the higher skill level, will help the players survive what is supposed to be a starter adventure.  

NOTE the rank titles are not the same between CT and CL. (TODO cross reference the rank titles from the career tables in CL )

# encumbrance 
CT  
normal load: a character may carry a load equal to his or her strength characteristic in kilograms  
double load: a character may carry up to twice to his or her strength characteristic in kilograms. STR DEX END are 1 less than normal.  
triple load: a character who is part of a military force ( mercenary unit: combat unit: troop unit) may carry up to triple his or her strength in kilograms. STR DEX END are 2 less than normal.  
The weight of equipment ( in grams is summed up )

CL simplifies encumbrance rules 
light load: may carry a number of major “items” equal to their STR with no penalty.
heavy load: may carry a number of major “items” up to 3 times their STR. DM-1 to all physical task throws and can only use a maximum of one move action in a combat round  

NOTE. The equipment tables in CL ( also CD ) do not list weights. Refer to the equipment description which should specify if the equipment encumbrance value is 0, 1, 2 etc. The referee has to assign an ecumbrance value for any equipment that is not listed in the rule set. My generic 
thought is  
0-4 kg = 1 item  
4-8 kg = 2 item   
etc  
see also https://www.reddit.com/r/cepheusengine/comments/1grrzfv/cepheus_engine_srd_equipment_list_and_specified/  



 
Regardless, in the shadows adevnture, the players are unlikely to be encumbered as there are no items to collect, unless one of the players is wounded or dies and other players collect the other players items or carry the other players body. 

# Modifications / clarifications to the adventure 

## the ventilation shafts 
When I drew the maps for the interior levels of the pyramid I offset the overhead ventilation shafts to one side of the corridor. In retrospect this causes the problem when moving tokens in Foundry that the tokens do not align with the grid because the ventilation shafts are offset from the grid.  

in the adventure pdf, diagram 2, showing the cieling vent in a large chamber and diagram 3 cross section of large and small corridors showing both have ventilation shafts. Small chambers also have a ventilation outlet. A logical question is, is would these outlets be same size as that in the large chambers - or smaller ( logic suggests smaller ). When I drew the maps I decided that all outlets be the same size so that players could get in / out of any ventilation shaft entry / exit point.  

For example. in the adventure pdf, location 17, as written
> This effect can be avoided by leaping the distance (3 meters; throw strength or less) or by crawling through the vent pipe overhead.

Using the ventilation shafts players can access the power plant even if players do not detect the secret door in location 9. NOTE That location 25 the corridor slopes DOWN towards the power plant level. 

issues: 
Using the scale on the diagram 2 the height of the base of the ventilation shaft is 3.5 metres above the floor. How do players get into the ventilation shafts ? 
( e.g. at least 1 person to boost a 2nd person up to the shaft ? ) 
I have drawn the ventilation shafts on the map as 1.5 meter in diameter metal pipes ( using an approximate scale comparison of the corridors in diagram 2 and 3). Once a player has crawled inside a ventilation shaft is 1.5 meter enough space to turn round whilst in a vacc suit - or only crawl forward or backward ? 
It is up to the referee to rule on this e.g. the referee may rule that the player can only turn round at junctions in the ventilation shaft where at least 2 shafts intersect. 
The referee should also consider if the player can only crawl forwards or backwards the player will not be able to fight any attack from animals that have come from
behind the player ( short of kicking back with their booted feet ).
do -ve DM's need to be applied to combat roles in such a combined space ? I'd rule yes for hack / slash weapons e.g. a sword  - for pistols no, rifles yes. 
Note in CL ranged weapons are by default -2 DM when used in melee range so I suggest add additional -DM's because of the restricted space to melee / shoot inside a ventilation shaft.   
The ventilation shaft at the fault in the corridor will also be fractured the same as the corridor. If a player enters / exits the ventilation shaft at a fracture ( logically ) the risk is higher of slashing or gashing the vacc suit on the jagged edges of the ventilation shaft. 
I suggest the referee advise the player of this risk and then have them roll a task check ( Zero-G skill in CL ) with failure resulting in loss of vacc suit integrity. 

For simplicity I suggest the referee assume the ventilation shafts from the power plant descend (vertically?) to the lvl2 from the power plant but these shafts cannot be accessed by players. 

## the atmosphere 
references:  
the adventure pdf    
CT special supplement 2 exotic atmospheres   

From the adventure pdf  

yorbund UWP C7C6503-7  

3. atmosphere C = insidious  
4. hydrosphere 6 = 60% water 

Yorbund is largely unexplored, with few individuals venturing far from the starport and associated caverns. Cloaked in a dense overcast atmosphere, little is known of the surface features of the world. As experience has shown, Yorbund is subject to seismic tremors, generally of low magnitude, but sometimes quite severe; such tremors have detected from nearly all points on the world's surface. Finally, the planet is known to be subject to considerable volcanism.

The local atmosphere is insidious, corrosive, and will defeat all personal protective measures within eight hours. The adventurers did not go outside at the starport, accessing facilities through tunnels and portals. Their vacc suits remain in prime condition. Once the suits are exposed to the local atmosphere, they will need reconditioning, at high cost in money (Cr200 each) and time (at least a week).

From the adventure pdf section Interior Features section atmosphere :

In most cases, the atmosphere is transparent, but close to floors, in depressions, and under the metal corridor platforms, it has condensed to a pinkish vapor, opague to visible and infrared light. This vapor can also be seen wafting down from ceiling vents, and accumulating to a depth of about ten centimeters. When (and if) analyzed, the atmosphere tester light glows red. The vapor will show a high percentage of halogens in addition to the expected gases.
( what expected gases ? From the computer scans whilst the scout ship was in orbit ? )

From the adventure pdf location 23 on deep level. 

An atmosphere tester with a serial number in the 4000 range will emit a beep, and the green and amber lights wlll come on. although the alr remains un-breathable In this chamber.  

Green and amber indicates that it is breathable but tainted. This suggests the gas composition in this room is less irritant / toxic than other chambers. Both the referee and the players will not know that the reason the atmosphere tester shows amber and green is that the atmosphere tester is faulty unless the referee has the library data from the annic nova / shadows double adventure. The mission on mithril / shadows double adventure does not include any of the details for the atmospheric tester other than red and green light and no mention of amber and green.

I suspect when shadows was played as a tournament adventure this potentially cause damage and / or death to any players that removed the vacc suit helmet thinking the atmosphere was breathable in location 23. 

Operation: The device is in constant operation, with LEDs indicating chemical symbol for the three major components in the gas sample, with percentage of total shown. Pressing the button labelled "More" replaces this with the next three components. Up to 30 components and percentages may be read in this manner, in addition, three lights (red, amber, and green) are mounted on the face of the device. Whenever the light (or lights) showing changes, an audible beep indicates the change. Red indicates that the atmosphere is not breathable. Green indicates that it is. Green and amber indicates that it is breathable but tainted. Red and amber indicates that the atmosphere is not breathable and also contains
material considered to be taint. Amber alone indicates a lack of pressure, but breathable mixture. The exact mixtures which trigger the lights are set at the factory, but may be adjusted to fit personal preference.

Serial Numbers: Sniffers are numbered in the format nnnn-xxxx-y. N is the model year number; the year of production. X is the serial number. Y is a check digit to insure the correct serial number is stated.

Recall Notice: Sniffers in the 4000 serial number range may have been assembled with a faulty detector head casing; this, in combination with the plastic case, allows gas to infiltrate onto the interior of the case. In some cases (insidious atmosphere) this may result in the contamination of the solid state electronics, and result in faulty readings, or outright failure. Such items should be returned to a factory representative for repair. Those with a two-digit check digit have already been recalled and repaired.

The players handout lists 3 atmosphere testers available for purchase. Three are available, serial numbers 1099-5768-3, 1099-5769-3, and 1099-4792-2. The 3rd one listed is faulty. 


## modifying the atmosphere from insidious to only corrosive or exotic 
references:
shadows adventure  
CT special supplement 2 exotic atmospheres  

Note of the halogens only flourine ( yellow ) and chlorine ( green ) are gases in natural state 

Neither yellow or green is consistent with pinkish or transparent as described in the adventure pdf. easiest option is to change the description of the gas from pinkish to some other colour consistent with the atmosphere ( and gases ) chosen.

I suggest the referee modify the atmosphere from insidious, corrosive to exotic - standard irritant. This is so that players exposed to the irritant atmosphere as a result of a fall, or animal attack, which compromises vacc suit inegrity, results in sickness, -DMs that accumulate, or loss of END, over time, vs instant death from an insidious atmosphere.
The irritant atmosphere also opens up the possibilities to the referee to consider other life forms other than acidophiles ( example of acidophiles includes fungi, bacteria, amoebas etc ). 

It is left up to the referee to determine reasons for the change in atmosphere, the most obvious is to relocate the adventure from Yorbund to some other planet or for e.g. the pyramid is on a planet that has had large nuclear fusion powered terraforming stations landed on the planet surface and it has been terraforming for 100's of years now.  
The adventure pdf does not include a backstory as to how or why Yorbunds atmosphere is insidious, i.e. did the reptilians set up the colony on Yorbund prior to some sort of cataclysm that resulted in the insidious atmosphere. 

Several of the exotic atmospheres classified as irritant are, in fact, mild forms of corrosive atmospheres. The chief difference between the two
lies in the degree of danger posed by the atmosphere — irritants cause only minor damage, while true corrosive atmospheres kill unprotected humans in a short time.

Ammonia (NH3): Ammonia is an irritant  Atmospheres containing ammonia will have to be extremely mild to classify as exotic rather than corrosive, for in any kind of concentration ammonia will cause serious damage even to exposed skin. Worlds on which ammonia is found in the atmosphere will be much like those described for methane - large, cold and with atmospheres falling in the standard.

The description of Amonia is not consistent with a planet with volanic activity as the temperature is required to be cold. 


Chlorine (Cl2): An irritant found in exotic atmospheres Greenish-yellow in color, chlorine is a deadly poison even in relatively small con-
centrations, though it can be detected by its odor long before it reaches a lethal level.

Sulfur Compounds:
In exotic atmospheres, sulfur compounds might represent the result of an extreme atmospheric taint resulting from prolonged heavy industrialization. Other components of the atmosphere could include oxygen, nitrogen, and other perfectly normal gases, but the air would be completely unbreathable. In other cases, sulfur compounds can be encountered as part of the natural atmosphere of a world, and pro-
bably go hand-in-hand with a great deal of volcanic activity,
Sulfur compounds would be a good alternative to the usual carbon-based organic chemistry. These would lead to a totally alien group of life forms.
The presence of sulfur compounds in sufficient concentrations will be corrosive, and can cause damage to unprotected individuals.

The referee notes of CT special supplement 2 exotic atmospheres lists gas types for sulfur compounds as fluorine-sulphur tetrachloride or other Sulphur compounds, carbon dioxide-sulphur dioxide, chlorine-disulphur dichloride

By and large, gas mixtures will revolve around one or two active ingredients, plus one or more inactive ones. Some fairly common mixes are noted on the previous page.

The actual gas mixes which go with worlds with hostile temperature ranges will vary. For worlds with high or extremely high temperatures, atmospheres can include our own familiar oxygen-nitrogen mix, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, chlorine, or fluorine, possibly with interesting sulfur compounds mixed in. Low-temperature worlds tend to have combinations of methana and ammonia in their atmosphere.

NOTE aside from Volanicism Yorbund is not listed as having hostile surface temperatures. 

I suggest the referee research gases for e.g. what atmospheres are consistent with terraforming ? ( i.e. what do scientists theorise as earth early atmosphere )

Acid rain, or acid deposition, is a broad term that includes any form of precipitation with acidic components, such as sulfuric or nitric acid that fall to the ground from the atmosphere in wet or dry forms.  This can include rain, snow, fog, hail or even dust that is acidic. 

The sulfur is consistent with a planet atmosphere described as 'almost perpetual overcast.' and that pyramid complex images generated by the computer are 'obscured by the overcast and the nature of the atmosphere below'.

Sulfur and volcanism is consistent with stormy cloudy atmosphere. This is also consistent with a planet that is being terraformed should the referee whish to use this as the reason for the change in atmosphere from toxic to irritant. The terraforming operation is consuming the gases resulting in less acidic conditions.  

### damage from exposure to the atmosphere 
The referee notes of CT special supplement 2 exotic atmospheres lists as damage from amonia as One point of damage is scored for every minute (four combat rounds)

No other mention of damage from other gas types is listed. 

I suggest the referee research gas toxicity of sulfur / nitrogen on the human body. Sulfur dioxide is colorless gas - only mildly toxic unless in high concentrations 

sulfur - yellow 
damage - Exposure to the toxic chemical may trigger severe respiratory tract irritation, coughing, and shortness of breath. Likewise, people who inhale sulfur may experience allergic reactions or asthma-like symptoms characterized by wheezing and chest tightness.
Sulfur exposure may also lead to severe skin irritation characterized by redness, itching, and inflammation. The victims may also suffer from more serious skin conditions such as erythematous and eczematous lesions, skin ulceration, and contact dermatitis.
Exposure to the hazardous compound is known to trigger adverse effects on eye health as well. 

halogen gases are irritants 
it is only mildly toxic and requires high concentrations to be actively hazardous.


Suphur dioxide ( SO2 ) leads to acid rain 
breathing smog or even any air with elevated sulfate concentrations is known to contribute to heart and lung conditions, including asthma and bronchitis

More water-soluble gases (e.g. chlorine, ammonia, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen chloride) dissolve in the upper airway and immediately cause mucous membrane irrita tion. The upper airway may be obstructed by edema, secretions, or laryngospasm. Permanent damage of the upper respiratory tract, distal airways, and lung parenchyma occurs only if escape from the gas source is impeded. Less soluble gases (e.g. nitrogen dioxide, phosgene, ozone) may not dissolve until they are well into the respiratory tract, often reaching the lower airways. These agents are less likely to produce early warning signs and are more likely to cause severe bronchiolitis, and often have a lag of ≥ 12 h before symptoms of pulmonary edema develop.

Sulfur dioxide can affect the body if it is inhaled or if it comes into contact with the eyes or skin. At inhalation exposure SO 2 can cause severe irritation of the nose and throat. Its irritant properties are due to the rapidity with which is forms H2SO4 on contact with moist membranes. At high concentrations it can cause life-threatening accumulation of fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema). The SO 2 is very toxic and can cause death. Symptoms may include coughing, shortness of breath, difficult breathing and tightness in the chest. A single exposure to a high concentration can cause a long-lasting condition like asthma.
Symptoms may include shortness of breath, tightness in the chest and wheezing. The gas irritates or burns the eyes. Permanent eye damage or blindness can result
source : https://mmsl.cz/pdfs/mms/2014/02/05.pdf

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur_dioxide
Sulfur dioxide is somewhat toxic to humans, although only when inhaled in relatively large quantities for a period of several minutes or more.

sulfuric acid is corrosive towards rocks and metals. this could be a problem in the context of the adventure considering the pyramid is made out of stone with a high metal content. 

I suggest the referee modify the atmosphere description 

In gaseous content, the interior atmosphere is similar to that on the world surface. The atmosphere is comprised of low levels of of sulfur dioxide , nitrogen and other halogens. However, vents and passages constantly keep the atmosphere in circulation. In most cases, the atmosphere is transparent, but close to floors, in depressions, and under the metal corridor platforms, it has condensed to a ~~pinkish~~ white ( which is also consistent with the vapor drawn on the dungeondraft maps at the vent shaft entrances ).
vapor, opaque to visible and infrared light. This vapor can also be seen wafting down from ceiling vents, and accumulating to a depth of about ten centimeters. When (and if) analyzed, the atmosphere tester light glows red.

The halogen content of the atmosphere is chlorine - which is as a gas at room temperatures, as is fluorine, but chlorine is less toxic than flourine.

More active, more poisonous, and more irritating to exposed skin than ammonia, chlorine in the atmosphere will be corrosive in any but the mildest
concentrations.

I suggest the referee rule that the conentration of chlorine in the atmosphere is enough to trigger the presence of chlorine as a halogen on the atmosphere tester, but not to the levels that cause corrosion and instant toxicity and / or irritation. The other reason for low levels of chlorine is that higher levels are consistent with insidious atmospheres - a planet with high percentages of chlorine in its atmosphere
at an Earth-like pressure and temperature could be expected to have large amounts of hydrogen chloride gas in the air and seas of liquid hydrochloric acid. 

TODO - home brew a rule to determine how much and how often to apply damage as result of exposure. 


## modifying the loss of vacc suit integrity resulting in instant death ( apply vacc suit damage rules )
For example. in the adventure pdf, location 9, as written 
> In addition, vacc suit integrity may be broken (throw 10+ to break integrity; DM - vacc suit skill), which will result in instant death.

My interpretation of this is that the the instant death is implied from the exposure to the insidious atmosphere, not the fall itself ( else a rule to calculate damage from the fall would be applied with the possibility the damage could result in death ). 

Falling from the cable is one example. Also consider in the adventure pdf in order for the 'animals' attack type  ( teeth / claws / blade ) to cause damage to players then the vacc suit would be pierced ( by teeth ) or slashed ( by claws ) resulting in loss of vacc suit integrity. Logic suggests this loss of vacc suit integrity would also result in instant death. 

In CL the closest rules with regards to loss of vacc suit integrity is in the section **atmosphere notes** is damage per round/s resulting from exposure.

I suggest the referee use rules to apply damage from expsoure to the atmosphere resulting from loss of vacc suit integrity but to stop the ongoing damage from exposure apply the concept of vacc suit patches for [example](https://www.travellerrpg.com/threads/vacc-suit-damage-rules.14675/)

The use of vacc suit patches, patches ( pun ) the logic hole that vacc suit loss of integrity results in slow ( ongoing exposure ) or instant death from the atmosphere.

## alternate ideas / plots / reasons for the player to investigate the pyramid

start the adventure with some other reason for the players to be on the planet ( if it is settled ) and have the players think this is the adventure e.g. players
are there to pick up some cargo or a person that needs to be transported. 

relocate the adventure to another planet ( e.g. a planet with breathable atmosphere - the pyramid is now in a jungle setting - e.g. the overgrown mayan pyramids ). 
the pyramid is on an unsettled planet. a terraforming corporation has landed ( from orbit )large scale industrial terraforming stations at locations on the planet. this explains the changing atmosphere from insidious to exotic. ( e.g the nuclear powered terraforming station in movie aliens ). these stations require maintenance / inspection. 
the players are on a ship that is sent out to do the maintenance. 
OR
the players are sent to investigate a ship that was sent out to do the maintenance but has not returned / responded to communications. the ship was shot down by the energy beam from the pyramid. survivors entered the pyramid ( only to perish inside from either animals or run out of oxygen )

the planet supports insect life e.g. similar to cockroaches. the amphibian grazers also feed on these cockroaches. 

change the animals to some other sort of animal that is not reptilian. 
the fungus the animals eat ends up controlling the animals brains and is part of the parasitic fungal life cycle. humans exposed to the fungal ( through loss of vacc suit inegrity begin to display changes in behaviour e.g. attack other players but also become resistant to the atmospheric effects. this could be combined with the previous idea of a prior ships crew that entered the pyramid but instead of running out of oxygen are now controlled by the fungus ) 


## rework the nature of the 'animals' 
in the adventure pdf, the animals, as drawn by the artist, the amphibian grazer (which is obviously a snake) is consistent with the reptilian theme. Refer the adventure pdf location 11 on lvl1, Marc Miller, the adevnture author, slips up, and writes snakes instead of grazers. The male ( chaser ) and female ( flying hunter ) adults as drawn look more like a dog with the head of bird and bat with a dogs head ( or is it a flying fox ? ) than anything reptilian. The logic hole in this is how does the juvenile snake mature into an adult male or female  neither of which is reptilian as drawn. 


I suggest the referee rework these animals or devise new types of animals and/or re-write the history and origins of the pyramid or devise some other mechanism that explains why the alien colony failed, such as a planetary cataclysm that changed the atmosphere to now the exotic / corrosive / insidious and the animals have since adapted / mutated / (d)evolved into their present form retaining only semblance of their former biology ( which was reptilian ).
Perhaps some sort of plague ( fungal in nature ? ) was the cause of the colony collapse.

For example, my plan is is to rework these animals description / appearance / drawings so that all 3 animal types are more consistent with the reptilian theme. Perhaps the animals were lesser / inferior forms of the same species as the aliens.


## setup some pre generated encounters to reflect the nature of the animals 
to show an example to the players the nature of the animals as cannabilistic setup a pre generated encounter - players enter a small chamber - and see either the chaser or the flyer feeding on the amphibian grazer. 

## location specific notes 

### location 1 accessing the deep ( 2nd ) level is by descending the shaft
in the adventure pdf, entry points, 2, as written
> The single flqure atop the pyramid is constructed so as to pivot
> It reveals a shaft of great depth
> The shaft is shown entering top of diagram 1. Descending this shaft will require cable, and a swinging motion once part way down. 

also note 
in the adventure pdf, entry points, 3, as written

issues:  
Using the scale on the diagram 1 showing the cross section of the shaft it is at least 15 to 20 metres from the top of the shaft to the floor level of the 1st level of the pyramid interior.  
Players require at least 1 cable to descend the 15 to 20 metres to level 1. ( more is required if the players use the cable like a rope lassoo to fasten one end to the statue )
Players require at least 2 connected cables to descend the 95 metres from level 1  to level 2 specified in the adventure.
3 cables total ( in CL count each cable as 1 for ecumbrance purposes ).  

Scenarios. 
1. players descend the 15 to 20 + 95 metres directly level 2.  
2. players descend to level 1 using 1 cable and then descend to level 2 using 2 cables.  

In scenario 2 with nothing to fasten the cable on players would need an alternate options to fasten the cable for example the players drill eye bolts into the metal platform or stone wall of the chamber.  

The plot hole in the adventure, as originally written, by listing the cables in the players handout as 1 of the 3 available equipment items for purchase, and not part of the ships locker, limits the players ability to play the adventure, if players don't use their credits to buy the cables, and at least 3, and most likely players would not buy 3 cables ( 300 credits vs 100 ) to save credits or to use credits to purchase other equipment. 
Without the cables the players would have to find the entrance to the interior in the stairs on the pyramid exterior but as noted, in the adventure pdf, as written, this doorway in the long stairway can only be detected and opened from inside the pyramid location 1.

I suggest the referee modify the adventure so that the cables ( at least 3 ) are in the ships locker. Should players not take this as a hint ( much the same as players in the adventure pdf should take it as a hint that cables are listed in the equipment that can be purchased ) then the referee can rule the players will need to return back to the ships locker to collect the cables. 

It is up to the referee to rule if the players have only the cables or also have eye bolts and drill they have also bought along for the purposes of exploration if the referee plays the adventure as originally written that chamber is bare of any features and does not even include fixtures on which to fasten cable or rope.  

This is also possibly a redundant consideration for the referee considering these contradictions in the adventure between location 1 and location 2 

in the adventure pdf, location 2, as written
> This chamber has a high level floor and is reached by climbing up a set of raised stair rungs

rungs, implies, rungs like on a ladder, as opposed to recessed steps. ( rungs is clearly an point to which a cable can be fastened ).

also refer to diagram 4 in the adventure pdf, which does not show any rungs for the high floor room. 

When I drew the maps for the interior levels of the pyramid to represent the high level floors I placed a metal stair rung image assett to model the description ( i.e. it was easier, than to try model steps cut into the curved side of the chamber ).
This then over rules the previous description that location 1 does not include any fixtures on which to attach cable or rope. ( and also negates any considerations regarding eye bolts and drills ) 


# outstanding questions 

## the origins of the reptilians and the history of the pyramid and the relationship between the reptilians and the animals 
in the adventure pdf, the referee's notes, summarised 
* voluntary exiles from an alien civilization seeded a colony ( as an experiment in esthetic simplistics, perhaps 50000 years ago ) with food and animals and settled into a simple life of contemplation in natural surroundings.  

corrosive-insidious does not seem consistent with 'natural surroundings' ( how esthetical is corrosion? ) or conducive to 'contemplation'.  

The animals were the only food source for the aliens. The food source for the 'amphibian graziers' (snakes) are the 'plants and fungi'

* the only remains of the colony is the is the pyramid the aliens congregated at regular intervals for group interaction
* the aliens were 'vaguely reptilian' with tails and bipedal ( having evolved from quadripedal 'carnivores')
* the aliens had a 3 fingered hand with 2 ( twin ) opposable thumbs
* due to the corrosive nature of the atmosphere in which non living creatures degrade rapidly ( literally dissolve into smoke in a matter of minutes ) the aliens custom was to eat live food ( i.e. no food could be prepared ) and meals were never a social function 

This answers the question, was the planet corrosive-insidious perhaps when the colony was seeded ?  

* to provide food, breeding chambers 2,4,6,8 were setup to produce small animals which were free to roam the interior of the pyramid
* aliens, to feed themselves, simply grabs one of the animals (from under the platform, or from the air) and eats it. selecting the particular taste the prefers by animal type and size.
* safety devices were included in the pyramid controls so that the animals could not trigger control mechanisms. the electric floor at locations 17, and the insert fingers into depressions to activate controls at locations 22 and 23. 
* some aliens lived 'in the wilds outside' the pyramid and some aliens lived in the pyramid 
* This colony failed many years ago. The food animals seeded outside dispersed, and the area proved unable to support the numbers of aliens present.

Logic suggests, considering with the description of mural in location 10, 'is the vast throng of reptitian-looking creatures (about human size) crowding around the complex' that the aliens living outside the pyramid had other food sources or food sources of the same type ( i.e the animals ) located outside of the pyramid in order to support the number of aliens described in the mural. 

* social interactions (among the pyramid operators) took place in location 24, the aliens sunned themselves on the raised stone dais ( 'sunned themselves' under artificial light as there is no natural light in the chamber )

* access from the interior level to the deep level by the aliens was by an elevator platform which travelled within the vertical shaft from 1 to 15.Safety interlocks have since made the elevator almost indetectable. and adventurers will probably not discover it

Locations 1, 14 and 15 do not mention this elevator in the location description. Logic suggests the elevator platform, though not functional, should still be present, perhaps in location 15 at the base of the shaft. Perhaps this is what the safety interlocks implies ? i.e. the elevator platform descended into a cavity in the floor of location 15 but this is 'almost' indectable. almost is not impossible. Perhaps the players notice a circular groove in the floor, the groove is the circumference of the platform recessed into the cavity.  
This also raises more questions, such as. How was the elevator activated ? The deep ( 2nd ) level location 21, mentions grippies, which can be used to facilitate climbing the pendulum cable. Why climb the cable if there is an elevator ? For maintenance only of the pendulum ( and the kicker at the top of the cable ? )

Note before discovering this elevator description in the adventure I had considered perhaps ( some e.g. only the elite, higher class / or perhaps all ) of the aliens had wings to be able to fly ( or at least glide down ) from one level to another.  

Note before discovering this elevator description in the adventure I had the thought of adding an elevator platform within the pyramid and was planning drawing in dungeondraft an alternate version of level 1 and level 2 maps by adding another large chamber accessed from a ( possibly hidden by a secret door ) corridor west of location 11 with a small ( magnetic, hydraulic, gravitic) lift shaft as an alternate mechanism ( possibly requiring players to repair ) of accessing the deep ( 2nd level ). i.e. should players have poor DEX / athletics skills or if players give up on the descending using the cable because of attacks by flyers whilst descending the cables - the random encounter tables do call for ecounters with flyers in the shafts.    

 
## the energy beam 
in the adventure pdf, the referee's notes, summarised

* the pyramids were ( esthetically ) symbolic to the aliens and the function of the energy beam, as shown in the mural in location 12, is to keep flying creatures away from its surface;their excrement left while they perch on it would detract from its appearance ( reducing the esthetics ). 

The 1st logic hole in this is, that the animals excrete un-esthetic excrement, e.g. animal droppings specifically listed in location 2, but the referee notes mention the animals were free to roam the pyramid interior. did the pyramid operators spend most of their time cleaning up the excrement in the pyramid interior. 
The 2nd logic hole in this is, as per the description of the mural in location 12, the energy beam cannot shoot at flyers in locations which are occluded by the smaller pyramids. i.e. if the ship can take off without danger from the energy beam if it first moves until occluded by one of the smaller pyramids and then lifts off so as to remain shadowed by that smaller pyramid - then does not the same logic apply to the flying animals that by chance fly to an occluded location on a smaller pyramid surface and then drop excrement at that location ( reducing the esthetics ).
Was the alien colony ever re-supplied by alien ships ? If so, the pyramid operators, must have temporarily disabled the energy beam so as not to shoot down the re-supply ships. 

in the adventure pdf, location 12, mural description, as written
> Flashes of energy are shooting from the faces of the large pyramid

Flashes (plural). There are 4 faces on the large pyramid. The pyramid is capable of shooting at least 4 energy beams. My thought is that it seems illogical ( requires suspension of disbelief ) that an energy beam can be shot out of solid stone. . 

in the adventure pdf, exterior, as written
> If the scout ship's laser is used, it will cut a 1.5 meter hole for each hit (assumed good accuracy at this range), but will also provoke an energy blast from the nearest face of the large pyramid.
> The three pyramid complex appears to be constructed of stone having a high metal content

there are no visible / recognisable devices on the pyramid surfaces that can be targeted as a source for the energy beam e.g. no gunnery device or even some crystal ( as used in a laser) structure. Perhaps the high metal content combined with high 'crystalline' content can be used as the basis to 'explain' that some piezo electric effect is responsible for the the capability to form an energy beam. 

  
## did all of the reptilians have wings ?
questions:
how did the human sized reptilians referred to in the mural in location 10 access the deep level ? did all reptilians have wings ? possibly but then note in the description for lvl2 location 21 the grippies which can be used to facilitate climbing the pendulum cable ? 
my plan ~~is~~ was to alter the map and include a chamber with a means to access the deep level e.g. the alien equivalent of a service goods / lift shaft perhaps 2 counter balanced metal platforms so that was one goes up the other goes down e.g. players are able to descened with their weight on the platform but then how do they counter weight the platform to use this to back up ? or the lift mechanism works using some sort of fluid that is pumped in ( like a hydraulic lift ) or magnetism 

OR there was some stairs  connecting the 1st and 2nd level ( which may be broken due to the seismic tremors ). there are stairs on the outside of the pyramid so the concept of stairs was known to the reptilians - perhaps spiral stairs to stay consistent with the pyramids curved and rounded interior.
