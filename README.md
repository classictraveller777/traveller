This is a copy of a Foundry VTT world folder for the classic traveller adventure shadows for use with the twodsix package  

The contents of this world folder is the scene maps, actors ( players and animals) tokens, artwork, JavaScript macros to simulate open doors closing as a result of seismic tremors, lights randomly toggled on / off, etc which represents the baseline 75 to 85% of setting up the adventure in Foundry VTT.

Because twodsix can be configured to be used with a number of traveller rulesets it is left up to the referee running this adventure to choose
the ruleset and configure both the twodsix package and also aspects of the adventure such as player and animal stats etc

The referee will need to source a copy of the traveller shadows adventure to run the adventure as the copy contains the location descriptions the scene maps were based on. 

refer the /readme/FoundryVTT_how_to_run_shadows_referee_notes for instructions on required Foundry modules, and notes how to teleport tokens through the levels, run macros etc.
